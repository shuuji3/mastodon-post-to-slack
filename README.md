üêò Send Mastodon post to Slack channel

Mastodon does support RSS feed natively. However, Slack RSS integration post all profile URLs in the conversation and its status URL, that took a large area in the channel and its body text is always duplicated.

This Python application solves the issues by cleaning up the text and including only needed links in the post.
